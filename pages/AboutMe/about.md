# About Me

Hola, I’m Steve Orozco – a passionate and driven cybersecurity professional with over 7 years of experience protecting organizations from cyber threats and enabling secure digital transformations. My journey in cybersecurity spans roles in both public and private sectors, where I’ve honed expertise in offensive and defensive security operations, penetration testing, digital forensics, and secure infrastructure design.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked with renowned organizations like the U.S. Air Force, Center for Internet Security, and Fortune 500 companies. My technical toolbox includes Windows Active Directory, Linux Systems Administration, digital forensics investigations, and designing robust systems using VMware, Proxmox, Kubernetes, and Azure.

Some of my proudest achievements include:
- Achieving 1st place in the competitive "Cyber-Yankee 2022" Capture the Flag event.
- Reducing enterprise vulnerability exposure by 35% through proactive threat assessments and mitigation.
- Developing and deploying enterprise-grade SIEM solutions that enhanced threat detection by 62%.

I’m not just about solving today’s cybersecurity challenges – I’m passionate about staying ahead of emerging threats and sharing knowledge with others. Whether it's mentoring teams, creating custom security tools, or writing whitepapers on advanced techniques, I aim to contribute to the security community in meaningful ways.

When I’m not diving into cybersecurity, you might find me outside with my wife and kids, repairing my house, or contributing to open-source projects. Let’s connect!
